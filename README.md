# Tesla Stock's Price Prediction

# Introduction:
    This Python script employs decision tree regression to predict stock prices using historical data of Tesla (TSLA). It utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and pandas for data handling. The dataset 'TSLA.csv' contains relevant information like opening, high, low prices, and volume.

# Code Overview:
  - Importing Libraries:
      NumPy for numerical computations.
      Matplotlib for plotting graphs.
      Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Loading Data:
      Data is loaded from the 'TSLA.csv' file using Pandas.
      Relevant features (columns) are selected for input (x) and output (y).
  - Data Preprocessing:
      Splitting the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split function from sklearn.
      Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler to normalize the features.
  - Building the Decision Tree Model:
      DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree is utilized to create the regression model.
      The model is trained using the training data.
  - Model Evaluation:
      The performance of the model is evaluated using the score method, which computes the coefficient of determination (R^2) of the prediction.
      Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.
  - Results:
      The score of the model on the test data is printed.
      Predicted values (y_pred) are obtained.

# Conclusion:
      The decision tree regression model is built and evaluated for predicting stock prices based on historical data. Further improvements in the model's accuracy can be explored by tuning hyperparameters or trying different regression algorithms. Additionally, incorporating more features or utilizing advanced techniques may enhance prediction performance.
